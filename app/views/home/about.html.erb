<div class="text_area">

<p>Talkaboutco.de is an audio experiment for the Unversity of Victoria's Computer Supported Collaborative Work class (SENG 435 / CSC 485), for fall 2011.  
The goal of the site is to investigate what happens when people talk about code, instead of type about it.
</p>

<p>We are powered by <%= link_to "SoundCloud", 'http://soundcloud.com' %>, <%= link_to "Heroku", 'http://heroku.com' %>, and the black magic of <%= link_to "Ruby on Rails", 'http://rubyonrails.org' %>.
</p>

<p>(We should put a link to our final paper here, and a bunch of references, and better copy in general.)
